# 🧬 Bio-Ops OS: Predictive Digital Twin
**The "Operating System" for the future of Biomanufacturing.**

## 🚀 Overview
Bio-Ops OS is a lightweight Digital Twin prototype designed to bridge the gap between legacy bioreactor monitoring and autonomous "Smart Factories." Using real-time sensor data and Linear Regression forecasting, it anticipates batch deviations before they violate GXP standards.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Predictive Forecasting:** Uses a Machine Learning engine to project 60-minute thermal trends.
* **Global Health Index:** A multivariate score that calculates batch stability by correlating Temperature and Pressure.
* **GXP Audit Reporting:** Generates instant compliance-ready CSV logs for deviation tracking.
* **Simulation Engine:** A "Stress Test" mode to simulate sensor drift and test alarm sensitivity.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Glassmorphism UI)
* **Data Science:** Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression), NumPy
* **Visualization:** Plotly (Interactive Time-Series)
* **Cloud:** Streamlit Community Cloud

## 📈 Market Context
Inspired by digital transformation initiatives at **Samsung Biologics** and **Dassault Systèmes**, this tool targets the $2.8B biomanufacturing digital twin market, focusing on Reducing Batch Loss in Cell and Gene Therapy.
